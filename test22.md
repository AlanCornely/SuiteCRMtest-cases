# Logs and Audit Records  
## Objective:  
Verify if the system adequately logs user activities and errors for auditing purposes.  

## Description:  
Tests the logging capability for actions such as logins, record creation/edits, and system errors.  

## Prerequisites:  
- Administrative access to SuiteCRM  
- Standard user account for testing  

### Steps:  
1. Perform actions with different users:  
   - Logins  
   - Record creation/edits  
   - Deletions  
2. Check logs in:  
   - Activity feed on the dashboard  
   - Admin panel  
3. Evaluate:  
   - Coverage of logged actions  
   - Ease of access  
   - Organization of information  

### Expected Result:  
The system should provide:  
- Complete logs of all actions  
- Unified audit interface  
- Intuitive visualization  

### Actual Result:  
 Partial functionality:  
 Basic logs on the dashboard  
 Error logs in the admin panel  
 No logs for edits/deletions  
 Lack of a unified interface  

### Analysis:  
The system has limited auditing capabilities, with fragmented information.  

### Critical Issues:  
- Incomplete activity tracking  
- Difficulty correlating events  
- Lack of log export/backup  

### Recommendations:  
1. Implement a unified logging system  
2. Record all critical actions  
3. Create audit reports  
4. Improve data visualization
