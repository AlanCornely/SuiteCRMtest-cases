# Report Export  
## Objective:  
Verify if the system exports reports in useful formats while maintaining data integrity.  

## Description:  
Tests the data export functionality for PDF, Excel, and CSV formats.  

## Prerequisites:  
- Access to SuiteCRM at https://crm.alunostds.dev.br  
- Existing data for export (e.g., contact list)  

### Steps:  
1. Access a module with data (e.g., Contacts)  
2. Select the export option  
3. Test formats:  
   - PDF (single record)  
   - CSV (multiple records)  
4. Verify:  
   - Data integrity  
   - File formatting  
   - Ease of use  

### Expected Result:  
The system should allow exporting:  
- Multiple records in PDF  
- Data in Excel format  
- CSV with preserved structure  

### Actual Result:  
 CSV works correctly  
 PDF limited to 1 record  
 No export option for Excel  

### Analysis:  
The export functionality has significant limitations.  

### Identified Issues:  
- PDF is not useful for reports  
- Lack of Excel support  
- Compromised usability  

### Recommendations:  
1. Implement PDF export for multiple records  
2. Add support for Excel (XLS/XLSX)  
3. Improve CSV formatting
