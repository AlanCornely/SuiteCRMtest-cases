# Required Field Validation  
## Objective:  
Verify if the system correctly validates required fields across different modules.  

## Description:  
Tests the validation of required fields during record creation in SuiteCRM.  

## Prerequisites:  
- Access to SuiteCRM at https://crm.alunostds.dev.br  
- Permission to create records  
- Modules tested: Tasks, Contacts, Accounts, Leads, Documents  

### Steps:  
1. Access each module (Tasks, Contacts, Accounts, Leads, Documents)  
2. Attempt to save a record without filling in required fields  
3. Verify:  
   - Save action is blocked  
   - Required fields are highlighted  
   - Clear error message is displayed  

### Expected Result:  
The system should prevent saving and clearly indicate the missing required fields.  

### Actual Result:  
✅ Validation worked in all tested modules  
✅ Error messages were clear and visible  

### Analysis:  
Required field validation is correctly implemented throughout the system.  

### Positive Points:  
- Consistency across different modules
