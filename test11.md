# Data Query Performance  
## Objective:  
Evaluate the system's response time when querying large volumes of data.  

## Description:  
Tests the performance of SuiteCRM when executing queries in modules with a significant number of records.  

## Prerequisites:  
- Access to SuiteCRM at https://crm.alunostds.dev.br  
- Modules with a substantial volume of data (e.g., 10,000+ contacts)  
- Stable internet connection  
- Updated Chrome browser  

### Steps:  
1. Access the Contacts module  
2. Execute queries with different filters:  
   - Simple search by name  
   - Advanced filter with multiple criteria  
   - Sorting by various fields  
3. Measure response time:  
   - Time to load the full list  
   - Time to apply filters  
   - Time to sort results  

### Expected Result:  

Queries should return in less than 5 seconds for reasonable data volumes.  

### Actual Result:  

Average of 3.8s for basic queries  
Peaks of up to 7s for complex filters  

### Analysis:  

Performance is within acceptable limits but has room for optimization in complex queries.  

### Possible Issues:  
- Increasing latency → Check database indexing  
- Timeouts → Adjust server configurations  
- Inefficient caching → Implement query caching  

### Evidence:  
- Response time report  
- Screenshot of the browser console (Network tab)  
- Video demonstrating the queries
